## Usage

To try out the ChatGPT Recreation, simply visit our website at https://chat-openai-six.vercel.app/. The website offers a user-friendly interface where you can start chatting with the chatbot right away.

## Technology Stack

For the frontend, I used React with TypeScript, which allowed me to create a robust and scalable user interface. React's component-based architecture and TypeScript's type checking capabilities were instrumental in building a reliable frontend.

On the backend, I utilized Node.js with Express to handle API requests and manage the communication between the frontend and the OpenAI API. Express provided a lightweight and flexible framework for building the server-side functionality.

To make UI development more convenient, I employed Chakra UI, a powerful library that facilitated the creation of responsive and aesthetically pleasing components. It greatly expedited the process of building the user interface.

## Request Limit

Since the ChatGPT Recreation relies on OpenAI's language model, it's important to mention that this is a paid service. To manage usage, each user is limited to 10 requests per hour. This ensures fair usage and helps maintain the availability of the service. Please keep this limit in mind while using the chatbot.

## Future Plans

I have several ideas for further enhancing this project. In the future, I plan to implement features such as conversation history persistence across sessions and user authentication for personalized experiences. These additions will make the chatbot more engaging and useful for users.
