Technology Stack

For the frontend, I used React with TypeScript, which allowed me to create a robust and scalable user interface. React's component-based architecture and TypeScript's type checking capabilities were instrumental in building a reliable frontend.

On the backend, I utilized Node.js with Express to handle API requests and manage the communication between the frontend and the OpenAI API. Express provided a lightweight and flexible framework for building the server-side functionality.

To make UI development more convenient, I employed Chakra UI, a powerful library that facilitated the creation of responsive and aesthetically pleasing components. It greatly expedited the process of building the user interface.
